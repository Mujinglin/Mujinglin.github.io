    - title: Through our interdisciplinary research based on data visualization and cinematic arts, we have generated four styles ending with a full stop, exclamation, question, and ellipsis, respectively. In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Hong Kong, and the death rate increased among the elderly due to their low vaccination rate. Using the same dataset, we created four data videos with different endings using punctuation marks. We hope that these can help the elderly in Hong Kong better understand vaccination knowledge and encourage them to get vaccinated. We aim to allow the general public to understand data more intuitively and effectively through our research combining data visualization and cinematic arts.

      embed_url: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnGEh5gRewM'
      description: This compelling short film unfolds around a protagonist with impaired vision who ingeniously feigns blindness. He also masquerades as a mind reader. Yet, his perceived psychic abilities are in truth grounded in his keen observation of human behavior, through which he astutely discerns individuals' motivations and psychological states.

A simple misunderstanding stemming from a phone number mix-up leads a girl to present herself as two distinctly different personalities during the day and night. By night, she engages in conversation with a gentle and warm demeanor, yet by day, she assumes an aloof and seemingly heartless guise. The story is imbued with the vibrancy and emotional fervor of youth.
